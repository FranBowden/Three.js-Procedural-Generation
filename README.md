# Procedural Cube Animation with Three.js

This project showcases a procedural generation animation using **Three.js**. It dynamically creates and animates cubes with adjustable parameters such as scale, translation, and rotation. The scene is rendered in real-time, allowing for interactive adjustments via **dat.GUI**. The project also includes **OrbitControls** for intuitive camera navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library.
- **dat.GUI**: Interface for real-time parameter tweaking.
- **JavaScript**: Core scripting language.
